# LinkMyBooks Ecommerce Accounting Automation: Save Hours Every Month, Automate VAT Compliance, Cut Costs by 50%

Running an ecommerce business is exciting until you hit month-end and realize you've got Amazon settlements, Shopify payouts, eBay fees, and a mountain of receipts that don't match your bank deposits. You know the drill: open spreadsheet, squint at numbers, manually enter transactions, try to figure out why your VAT doesn't add up, give up, order coffee, try again.

Here's the thing nobody tells you when you start selling online: the actual selling part is the easy bit. It's the bookkeeping that'll drive you bonkers.

I spent way too long doing this stuff manually before I realized there had to be a better way. Turns out, there is. It's called LinkMyBooks, and honestly, I wish someone had told me about it three years ago when I was drowning in spreadsheets at 11 PM on a Tuesday.

## What LinkMyBooks Actually Does (Without the Marketing Fluff)

LinkMyBooks is accounting automation software built specifically for ecommerce sellers. It connects your selling platforms—Amazon, Shopify, eBay, Etsy, Walmart, TikTok Shop, WooCommerce, Square—to your accounting software (Xero or QuickBooks) and does all the tedious reconciliation work automatically.

When a payout hits your bank account, LinkMyBooks has already broken down every penny: sales, refunds, fees, taxes, shipping costs. It creates a summary entry in your accounting software that actually makes sense. One click, and everything's reconciled.

No more manual data entry. No more wondering if you've double-counted a refund. No more panic attacks before tax season.

The software was built by ex-ecommerce sellers and accountants in the UK, which explains why it actually works the way real sellers need it to work. They've clearly spent time in the trenches dealing with Amazon's Byzantine settlement reports.

## The Problem Most Sellers Don't Know They Have

Most ecommerce sellers use QuickBooks or Xero for accounting. Great software, both of them. But here's the issue: they're designed for general businesses, not specifically for the weird world of marketplace selling.

When Amazon pays you, the amount that hits your bank account isn't your actual sales. It's sales minus fees minus refunds plus some tax adjustments minus fulfillment costs plus... you get the idea. Your bank shows one number, your sales report shows a completely different number, and trying to reconcile these manually is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded.

Most sellers handle this in one of three ways:

1. Spend hours each month manually entering transactions (fun!)
2. Pay their accountant £200/hour to do it (ouch!)
3. Just ignore proper bookkeeping until tax season (yikes!)

None of these options are great. The first wastes your time, the second wastes your money, and the third is playing Russian roulette with HMRC or the IRS.

LinkMyBooks solves this by automating the entire process. It pulls data directly from your selling platforms, categorizes everything correctly, handles VAT or sales tax automatically, and sends clean, reconciled entries to your accounting software.

## How LinkMyBooks Compares to Doing It Manually (Or Paying Someone Else)

Let me paint you a picture of what monthly bookkeeping looks like before and after LinkMyBooks.

**Before LinkMyBooks:**
- Download settlement reports from Amazon, Shopify, eBay
- Open massive CSV files that make your eyes hurt
- Manually categorize transactions: this is a sale, this is a refund, this is a fee
- Try to figure out VAT on each transaction
- Enter everything into QuickBooks or Xero line by line
- Realize numbers don't match bank deposits
- Spend another hour finding the discrepancy
- Total time: 4-8 hours per month
- Accuracy: questionable at best
- Your emotional state: drained

**After LinkMyBooks:**
- Open LinkMyBooks
- Click "sync"
- Check that everything looks right (takes 2 minutes)
- Done
- Total time: 15 minutes per month
- Accuracy: perfect (it's automated)
- Your emotional state: relieved

The software saves the average seller between 10-20 hours per month. For some high-volume sellers, it's closer to 40 hours. That's a full work week you get back to focus on, you know, actually growing your business.

## LinkMyBooks Pricing: What You Actually Pay

One thing I appreciate about LinkMyBooks is their pricing is transparent and based on your order volume, not some arbitrary tier system that penalizes growth.

Here's how their pricing works in 2026:

| Plan | Orders Per Month | Sales Channels | Monthly Price (USD) | Historical Data | Best For |
|------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 200-1,000 | 1 channel | $35/month | 3 months | New sellers, single platform |
| **Pro** | 1,000-5,000 | 5 channels | $99/month | 12 months | Growing multi-channel sellers |
| **Premium** | 5,000-10,000 | 10 channels | $199/month | 24 months | High-volume sellers |
| **Enterprise** | 10,000+ | 10+ channels | Custom pricing | 24 months | Large operations, accountants |

*Note: Prices shown in USD. Also available in GBP and AUD. Annual subscriptions save you 2 months (equivalent to getting 12 months for the price of 10).*

**What counts as a sales channel?**
Each Amazon Merchant ID, eBay store, Etsy shop, or Shopify store counts as one channel. The nice part: with Amazon, you get unlimited marketplaces per Merchant ID. So if you sell on Amazon UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, NL, SE, PL, and BE through one European account, that's still just one channel.

**What counts as an order?**
One customer order = one order, regardless of how many items they buy. Simple.

**Can you add multiple platforms?**
Absolutely. The Pro plan lets you connect Amazon + Shopify + eBay + Etsy + Walmart all under one subscription. No per-channel fees like some competitors charge.

## LinkMyBooks vs A2X: The Honest Comparison

If you've been researching ecommerce accounting software, you've probably come across A2X. It's the established player that's been around forever. LinkMyBooks is the newer alternative that's been gaining serious traction, especially in the UK and EU.

Here's the breakdown:

| Feature | LinkMyBooks | A2X |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Setup time** | 15 minutes with guided wizard | 1-2 hours, often needs accountant help |
| **VAT automation** | Built-in VAT logic for UK/EU sellers | Manual tax mapping required |
| **Multi-channel pricing** | All channels in one plan | Charges per channel (gets expensive) |
| **Customer support** | In-house accountants, 1:1 onboarding | Email support, premium tiers get phone |
| **Price for 5 channels** | $99/month (Pro plan) | $229/month (Multi Premium) |
| **Annual savings vs A2X** | — | Save $1,560/year with LinkMyBooks |

A2X is solid software, no doubt. But it was built for accountants managing large enterprise accounts. The setup is complex, tax mapping is manual, and if you sell across multiple platforms, the costs add up fast.

LinkMyBooks was built for sellers first. The setup wizard walks you through everything in plain English, VAT rules are automated (massive for UK/EU sellers), and the pricing scales with your business without penalizing you for selling on multiple platforms.

## Features That Actually Matter

Let's talk about what LinkMyBooks does day-to-day:

### Automated Payout Reconciliation
Every time a selling platform pays you, LinkMyBooks breaks down the payout: sales, refunds, fees, taxes, shipping. It creates a summary entry in Xero or QuickBooks that matches your bank deposit exactly. One-click reconciliation, or set it to auto-post and it happens automatically.

### VAT/Sales Tax Automation
This is huge for UK and EU sellers. LinkMyBooks automatically calculates and categorizes VAT based on product types (standard, reduced, zero-rated), country, and marketplace facilitator rules. The HMRC VAT file is attached to every entry in your accounting software. Come tax time, everything's already sorted.

For US sellers, it handles sales tax the same way—automatically categorized by state, ready for your CPA.

### COGS Tracking
Cost of Goods Sold tracking is built in. As you sell through inventory, LinkMyBooks automatically tracks COGS, giving you accurate profit margins without manual calculations.

### Multi-Currency Support
Selling internationally? LinkMyBooks handles multi-currency transactions automatically, converting everything to your base currency using real-time exchange rates.

### Financial Analytics Dashboard
See performance across all your sales channels in one place: revenue, fees, refunds, profit margins. Finally, a clear picture of which channels are actually making you money.

### Historical Data Import
Need to catch up on old bookkeeping? The Starter plan includes 3 months of historical data, Pro gets 12 months, Premium gets 24 months. You can also purchase additional historical data as a one-time fee if needed.

## Who LinkMyBooks Is Perfect For

**New ecommerce sellers:** Get your accounting set up properly from day one instead of cleaning up a mess later. The Starter plan is affordable ($35/month) and grows with you.

**Multi-channel sellers:** If you're selling on Amazon + Shopify + eBay + Etsy, LinkMyBooks saves you a fortune compared to per-channel pricing from competitors. Everything under one subscription.

**UK and EU sellers:** The built-in VAT automation alone is worth the price. No more manually mapping tax codes or worrying about OSS compliance.

**Anyone who values their time:** If you'd rather spend 15 minutes on bookkeeping instead of 8 hours, this is a no-brainer.

**Accountants and bookkeepers:** They have a partner program where you can manage multiple client accounts under one subscription with flexible billing.

## Is LinkMyBooks Worth It? The Bottom Line

Here's my honest take after researching this extensively and talking to sellers who use it:

If you're doing manual bookkeeping for your ecommerce business right now, LinkMyBooks will save you 10-20 hours per month minimum. That time has value—either you're billing it to clients (if you're an accountant), or you could be using it to source better products, optimize listings, or literally anything more valuable than data entry.

The cost-benefit math is simple: even the most expensive plan ($199/month for high-volume sellers) saves you more in time than it costs. One hour of your time at even minimum wage pays for a month of the Starter plan.

For UK and EU sellers specifically, the VAT automation alone is worth the subscription. Manual VAT mapping is tedious and error-prone. Getting it wrong costs money in penalties or overpaid tax. LinkMyBooks handles it automatically and attaches the HMRC-compliant VAT file to every entry.

The alternative—using A2X—costs significantly more if you're multi-channel and still requires manual tax setup. Most sellers switching from A2X to LinkMyBooks save over $1,500 annually while getting easier setup and better support.

**LinkMyBooks is worth it if:**
- You value your time more than $35/month
- You sell on multiple platforms
- You're based in UK/EU and need VAT automation
- You want accounting that just works without constant maintenance
- You're tired of spreadsheet hell

**Skip it if:**
- You enjoy manual data entry (no judgment)
- You have a full-time bookkeeper who loves reconciling marketplace payouts
- You only sell occasionally and have under 50 orders per month
- You're already deeply embedded in another system and it's working fine

For most ecommerce sellers, LinkMyBooks is one of those tools where you wonder how you lived without it. The 14-day free trial gives you plenty of time to test it with your actual data before committing.

## Final Thoughts

Look, bookkeeping isn't why you started an ecommerce business. You probably got into this because you wanted to build something, sell products you believe in, work for yourself, make some money. Nobody dreams of reconciling Amazon settlement reports at midnight.

The reality is that proper bookkeeping matters. It matters for taxes, for understanding if you're actually profitable, for making smart business decisions, for not panicking when HMRC or the IRS comes knocking.

But it doesn't have to consume hours of your life every month. That's the entire point of automation.

LinkMyBooks does one thing really well: it takes the tedious, error-prone work of ecommerce accounting and makes it automatic. It's not flashy, it's not revolutionary, it's just solid software that works reliably and saves you time.

The 14-day free trial is genuinely risk-free (no credit card required), so there's no reason not to test it with your actual business data. Worst case, you spend 15 minutes setting it up and decide it's not for you. Best case, you get 10+ hours back every month to focus on growing your business.
